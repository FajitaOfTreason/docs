description: Will Streamer.bot add support for Kick, TikTok, or another platform?
---
**[Kick](https://kick.com) support is *ONLY* available in version 1.0.0.**
- With version 1.0.0 Streamer.bot uses webhooks to receive events from Kick. Kick does not always send out events like Chat Messages in a timely manner, meaning there can be delays happening til something triggers in Streamer.bot.
- It was originally declared that the forthcoming Kick Integration would be limited as a supporter perk. However, due to all the support, the Kick integration will be part of the core of Streamer.bot, and will be free for all to use.
- Once Kick introduces websocket support, for which there is an issue open regarding this on their [GitHub](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs/issues/20), it will be looked into to switch to that instead of webhooks.

**[TikTok](https://tiktok.com) support will be considered if/when they release a usable public API.**
- TikTok API support is unknown at this time, but a Streamer.bot integration is available by [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/streamerbot-integration)

**Other Platforms**
- Other platforms, if there is already a public API available, please let us know at [Streamer.bot Ideas & Suggestions](https://ideas.streamer.bot)
