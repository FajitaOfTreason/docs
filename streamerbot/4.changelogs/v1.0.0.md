### Hey Everyone,

I wanted to give a brief update about **Streamer.bot 1.0**. At the moment, the current alpha, ‘alpha.36’, seems to be fairly stable. I don’t anticipate many more alpha updates. The good news is that a `beta` and/or `stable` release is on the horizon.

Now, I don't like bringing this up, but it’s becoming more of a problem as time goes on. I've been out of work since **August 2024**. That's almost a year now, and my Patreon for **Streamer.bot** is the only thing that has been keeping me afloat.

**Streamer.bot** is going to be turning **5** years old pretty soon, and I've kept it **free** this entire time (and it will remain free) as a kind of passion project. With new features being added so regularly, **Streamer.bot** has grown to be so much more than simply something to mess with in my free time. As it is, **Streamer.bot**, will always be **free**, this is not changing.  Nevertheless, **1.0** will be bringing some **new** advanced features that will start costing money to implement on the backend, so they will be **supporter perks**, available to those subscribing at the lowest `Thank You` Patreon tier. To be perfectly honest – the more support there is on Patreon overall, the more that can be kept free.

Many might not realize, but **Streamer.bot** isn’t some startup with dozens of developers working on it. It is a registered business in Ontario, Canada. But the programming and development is pretty much a **one-man** show. (I do get help from Whipstickgostop for everything website-related; I do not want to diminish his contributions in the slightest. Kudos should also go to Lyfesaver and everyone on the support staff as well) Similarly, running **Streamer.bot** and the supporting website and services also cost money. There are fees related to the code signing certificate, IFTTT, domains, servers, etc. As a business, I do my best to present everything as professionally as possible. While I may not create content on `YouTube`, `Twitch` or the like, I still provide a valuable tool for those who do, and I think it's time I hopefully can start benefitting from it.

Thank you, sincerely thank you to everyone who has been using **Streamer.bot** over the years, it means a lot to see the community that has been built around it, and it still blows my mind that I created something like this.  **Streamer.bot**, and **Speaker.bot** are not going anywhere and I plan on working on them for years to come.

**Yours truly,**

CEO/DEV Streamer.bot

So, here is what's available in **alpha.37** available now, for those subscribed to the `Bronze Tier` on Patreon to use and test!
## Kick
Yes, you read that right! `Kick` is becoming the fourth platform added to **Streamer.bot**!

After thinking long and hard, and going back and forth on possible implementations of time/cost for getting it done, `Kick` is being supported, but will require a connection on the website in order to make it work.  This means the website is acting as a relay in order to get events from `Kick`.

While in alpha, any alpha user will have access to it, and once it is released to stable/beta, the `Thank You` tier on my Patreon will be required to use it, to support the back-end services.
## Cloud Backups
While backups have always been created, and more recently you're able to change the backup folder, **Streamer.bot 1.0** is bringing `Cloud Backups`.  You will be able to manually create a backup that is stored on the **Streamer.bot** servers, and can also restore your **Streamer.bot** from one of these backups.

While in alpha, any alpha user will have access to them with limits based on the Patreon tier they are subscribed at.  Once it is released to stable/beta, the `Thank You` tier will be required with lower limits than the `Bronze Tier`
## Custom Webhooks
**Streamer.bot** currently supports **4** services through webhooks: `Patreon`, `Kofi`, `Fourthwall` and `Shopify`.  Since Webhooks require an intermediary site with full SSL capabilities typically, `Custom Webhooks` are being introduced. These will allow you to create your own webhooks to (almost) any site that supports them.

While in alpha, any alpha user will have access to them with limits based on the Patreon tier they are subscribed at.  Once it is released to stable/beta, the `Thank You` tier will be required with lower limits than the `Bronze Tier`

**NOTE** There will be a few sites that will be outright denied from creating webhooks for, largely for volume reasons, and this will be monitored for abuse.
## Decks 2.0
Yes, `Decks 2.0` are also being released! `Decks 2.0` will remain mostly free, however there will be some modest limits placed on them, and subscribing to Patreon will increase these limits based on the subscription tier.

## Details
Surprise!  This has been 3 months in the making, but there is finally a new UI in town, and it's been completely re-written in WPF.  This means I'll have so much more flexibility.  In addition to that, there is now a `Dark Mode`, the most requested feature.

Now for the bad news, I have not tested this, so  I'm not sure how this will effect extensions that use custom designed WinForms dialogs for settings and such.  The conversion to WPF is quite simple, and I will likely post a small template at some point to get you started.

Now, this is an alpha, this means there **will** be bugs, that is the whole point of it entering this stage first.  If you wish to use this as your daily driver, be aware, things may or may not function correctly.

Want access to `alpha`, subscribe to [nate1280's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nate1280).  `alpha` access now starts at `Bronze Tier` or higher.
### Sub-Actions
Sub-actions got a bit of an overhaul as well, before, groups could only be top level items, now, they can be nested as much as you want, more flexibility when using the random option on a group now.
#### Logic If/Else
Logic If/Else has received a power-up, no longer do you need to specify an action to run for the true/false parts, you can now just add your sub-actions directly to the true/false groups, and because these are containers, that means you can nest groups as well.
#### Logic Switch
New with this release is a new Logic sub-action, the Switch Case.  Same applies to this sub-action, add your logic switch, and you can add case groups, which can in turn have sub-actions nested in them
#### Logic While
New with this release is the `Logic While` sub-action.  Yes, that means you can finally perform loops within a single action without needing C#!
### Inline Function,
A new function has been added, `$parse()$`, that will allow for a 2nd level of variable parsing.

This would be of benefit for the newly added `Logic While` sub-action.

As an example, ff you are using the global `~idx~` as your test variable, and incrementing this within the while loop.  You would then be able to use the inline method like `$parse(rawInput~idx~)$` which would internally parse to `%rawInput#%`, and finally would return the value of the `%rawInput#%` argument. In this example, `rawInput` is the argument you're wanting to get an indexed position of, this is typically used in most `Message` based triggers
### Twitch
Twitch PubSub is being deprecated in April, so that means it's finally time to remove PubSub from the connection list for the Broadcaster Account.

What this means, the Ad Mid Roll sub-action no longer exists (to this day, still really don't know what it did), Channel Point Community Goals will cease to work until they're added to EventSub, and the Viewer count pulse has been updated to use other methods.
### Twitch Shared Chat
Handling of `Twitch Shared Chat` has been updated a bit, there are now **3** arguments added to most `Twitch` events.
* `isInSharedChat` - This will indicate if the event happened while in a Shared Chat,
* `isSharedChatHost` - This will indicate if the Broadcaster is the host of the Shared Chat,
* `isFromSharedChatGuest` - This will indicate if the event is from a Shared Chat's Guest's Channel,
These 3 arguments are in all Shared Chat events, as well as the non-shared chat event counter parts.
### Quotes
Quotes got a small overhaul, the built in `!quote` command is no more, it has been replaced with various sub-actions, so you now have full control over adding, deleting quotes by any means.
### HTTP Server
You read that right, you can now serve **local files** with the `HTTP Server`! Simply add a `Path Mapping` to the `HTTP Server` settings, and you can access any file/folder from that `Mapping`.

The current methods are being moved to an `/api/` prefix, and they will continue to work for now but consider them deprecated, and will eventually be removed.  Be sure to update any usages to use the `/api/` equivalent.
### Voicemod
The `Voicemod` integration has been udpated to support `v3`, and version `3.12` is now the **minimum required** version for the integration.

With the update, the `Voicemod Set Censor State` sub-action was removed, as well as 2 C# methods, `VoiceModCensorOn()` and `VoiceModCensorOff()`, as the methods for these no longer work.
## Kick Platform
Yes, you read that right, as of `alpha.37`, **Streamer.bot** now supports `Kick` as an official platform.  Be sure to read the previous information in alpha-releases or announcements.

Overall the `Kick API` is still a bit of a mess, and everything that can be implemented has been.  And as mentioned, to use this platform integration, you **must** link your Kick account on the website as well!

There are new sub-actions and triggers for Kick, support for `Kick Message` as a Command source, `Kick` will show up in the chat as well as obs overlay chat.
## Cloud Backup
You will be able to manually create backups that are encrypted and uploaded to *Streamer.bot's** website, as well as being able to restore from these backups.
## Custom Webhooks
You will be able to create custom webhooks, and have the data forwarded to your **Streamer.bot**, much like the existing webhooks, except they can be used for any site that supports webhooks.  This feature will be monitored for abuse and limits put in place if anything like this is detected
## Decks 2.0
They've been teased for a while, but `Decks 2.0` are also here!  This includes a handful of sub-actions to interact with the decks themselves, much like `Elgato Stream Deck`
## New Website
Whipstickgostop has been hard at work, and there is a new website that launched alongside this update, both as a refresh and to support all the new features.
### C# Changes
The following C# methods have been updated to account for the new `useBot` and `fallback` options.
```cs
void SendYouTubeMessage(string message, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true, string broadcastId = null);
void SendYouTubeMessageToLatestMonitored(string message,bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
void SendTrovoMessage(string message, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
```
