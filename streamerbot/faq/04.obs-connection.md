description: Why is my Streamer.bot not connecting to OBS?
---
There could be various reasons for this, but here are some common solutions:

- Ensure that the **Enable WebSocket Server** option is enabled in OBS
- Ensure you have entered matching `IP`, `Port`, and `Password` configuration in both OBS and Streamer.bot
- If Streamer.bot and OBS are running on the same PC, use `127.0.0.1` as the IP, otherwise make sure you are using the correct LAN IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.x`)
- If you are trying to access OBS over an outside network, such as a VPN or tunnel, you should bind the OBS WebSocket server to `0.0.0.0`
- If you are on the same network, you can consider deactivating authentication
- In rare cases, the default port `4455` is already occupied, you can try changing it to something else like `4456` or `1234`
- Make sure you are using the correct `obs-websocket` version. If you aren't sure, you should select `v5.x` on the connection configuration in Streamer.bot
