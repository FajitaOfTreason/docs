## Introduction
This is a simple cross-platform app that runs in the background, allowing for a browser source to be displayed on the creator's desktop, creating an overlay on their own screen.

For example, the app comes preconfigured to show a simple dark splat that will cover most of the screen, (think Mario Kart oil spots) distracting them.

All you need to do is create a Channel Reward with the name ***SPLAT*** then relax and enjoy the distraction.

It also comes preconfigured to rain emotes down over the content on screen.

::warning
This feature requires the **WebSocket Server** to be enabled in your Streamer.bot application

::

### Configuration

::warning
Your **Streamer.bot WebSocket Server** must be **enabled** for the application to interact with your bot
::

#### Streamer.bot Connection
By default, the HTML Overlay will attempt to connect to your Streamer.bot WebSocket Server using the default settings, `http://localhost:8080/`.

If you have changed the `host`, `port`, or `endpoint` values of your WebSocket server, you can configure this by modifying the `Content/index.html` file within the HTML Overlay directory.

## Included Overlays
The HTML Overlay `zip` above is preloaded with 3 overloay modules:

- Splat!
- Show Image
- Emote Rain

::tip
You can customize the options for each module by modifying each respective `.js` file
::

### Splat
Display a large paint splat on your screen.

#### Options
```js
const CONFIG = {
  // The title of the Channel Point Reward that will trigger the effect
  rewardTitle: 'SPLAT',
};
```

### Show Image
Display any image (from a URL) on your screen.

#### Options
```js
const CONFIG = {
  // The title of the Channel Point Reward that will trigger the effect
  rewardTitle: 'Show Image',

  // The URL of the image to show
  imageUrl: 'https://streamer.bot/logo.png',

  // The number of seconds to show the image for
  seconds: 5,

  // The width and height of the image (css)
  width: 'auto',
  height: 'auto',
};
```

### Emote Rain
Generate raining emotes from incoming Twitch chat messages.

#### Options
```js
const CONFIG = {
  // The maximum number of emotes to display at once
  maxEmotes: 20,

  // The size of the emotes (css)
  emoteSize: '100px',
};
```

## Custom Overlays
::warning
Custom overlays are an **advanced** use case and require **JavaScript** expertise
::

To get started, create a new `js` file inside the `Content` directory.

::tip
The configured [Streamer.bot Client](https://streamerbot.github.io/client) instance is available at `window.client` for interacting with Streamer.bot via WebSocket and subscribing to events
::

Here we are using the source of the included `show-image.js` as an example:

```js [Content/my-module.js]
const CONFIG = {
  rewardTitle: 'Show Image',
  imageUrl: 'https://streamer.bot/logo.png',
  seconds: 5,
  width: 'auto',
  height: 'auto',
};

// Here we are subscribing to Twitch Channel Point Rewards
// and triggering our overlay when the configured title matches a redemption
window.client.on('Twitch.RewardRedemption', (message) => {
  if ((message.data.reward.title || message.data.title) === config.rewardTitle) {
    showImage();
  }
});
```

Import your new module at the bottom of `Content/index.html`, after any existing `<script>` tags

```html [Content/index.html]
<!-- Add this at the end, after any existing <script> tags! -->
<script type="module" src="my-module.js"></script>
```

::tip
Take a look at the existing modules in the `Content` directory for examples
