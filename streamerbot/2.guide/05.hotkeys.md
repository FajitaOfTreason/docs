::

## Inputs

If you wish to execute your actions with keyboard shortcuts or mouse inputs, you can use the following trigger inputs:

### Keyboard Press
:read-more{to=/api/triggers/core/inputs/key-press}

### Mouse Click
:read-more{to=/api/triggers/core/inputs/mouse-click}


## Outputs

You can also simulate keyboard inputs *from* Streamer.bot using the [Keyboard Press](/api/sub-actions/core/system/keyboard-press) sub-action.

This can be useful if you wish to trigger hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts in other applications.
