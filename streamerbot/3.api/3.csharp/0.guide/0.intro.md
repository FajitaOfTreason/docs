## CPHInline Class

::note
`CPH` refers to the original development name of Streamer.bot, `ChannelPointsHandler`
::

When you add a new [Execute C# Code](/api/sub-actions/core/csharp/execute-csharp-code) sub-action, you will be greeted with the following code snippet:

```cs
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        // your main code goes here
        return true;
    }
}
```

::warning
For every execute code sub-action, **this is the minimum that must be present for it to function.**
::

Within all C# code actions you have access to the `CPH`{lang=cs} class, allowing you to make calls to internal Streamer.bot methods.

### `Execute()`

When your C# sub-action is executed, the `Execute()`{lang=cs} method is always called.

This is where you should place your main code logic, as shown in the example below:

```cs [Example.cs]
public bool Execute()
{
    CPH.LogInfo("Hello from C#");
    return true;
}
```

Normally this method returns `true`{lang=cs} to allow execution of any subsequent sub-actions.

If for some reason you would like to **cancel further execution**, and skip any remaining sub-actions in the current action, you can return `false`{lang=cs}.

```cs [Example.cs]
public bool Execute()
{
  if (someCondition) {
    CPH.LogInfo("This action will now stop executing further sub-actions.");
    return false; // Stop execution of further sub-actions
  }

  return true; // Allow further execution
}
```

### Custom Methods

You can also define your own custom methods within the `CPHInline`{lang=cs} class, and call them from within the `Execute()`{lang=cs} method.

```cs [Example.cs]
public bool Execute()
{
    CPH.LogInfo("Starting execution...");
    CustomMethod();
    return true;
}

public void CustomMethod()
{
    CPH.LogInfo("Hello from a custom method!");
}
```

## Window Actions

Within the C# code dialog, you have access to several button actions:

| Action               | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Format Document**  | Automatically format your code with proper indentation                                                     |
| **Find Refs**        | Attempt to automatically find some common references based on your `using`{lang=cs} directives.                     |
| **Compile**          | Test the compilation of your code and check for errors.                                                    |
| **Save and Compile** | Save your changes, and pre-compile the code so it's ready to go the first time the action is hit |
| **Ok**               | Save your changes                                                                                          |
| **Cancel**           | Discard your changes                                                                                       |
