In addition to the `Execute()` method, you can also implement the lifecycle methods outlined below.

::tip
All lifecycle methods are **optional**
::

### `Init()`
The `Init()`{lang=cs} method is executed when your code is first compiled, including during Streamer.bot startup.

This is useful if you need to perform any initialization steps, such as setting up class-level variables or initializing objects that will later be used in your `Execute()`{lang=cs} method.

::code-group
  ```cs [Signature.cs]
  public void Init();
  ```
  ```cs [Example.cs]
  using System;

  public class CPHInline
  {
      public bool Execute()
      {
          // your main code goes here
          return true;
      }

      public void Init()
      {
          // place your init code here
      }
  }
  ```
::

### `Dispose()`
The `Dispose()`{lang=cs} method is always executed on destroy, including during Streamer.bot shutdown.

This is useful when you need to perform some cleanup, such as disposing of objects or freeing up resources that were allocated during the lifetime of your code action.

::code-group
  ```cs [Signature.cs]
  public void Dispose();
  ```
  ```cs [Example.cs]
  using System;

  public class CPHInline
  {
      public bool Execute()
      {
          // your main code goes here
          return true;
      }

      public void Dispose()
      {
          // place your dispose code here
      }
  }
  ```
