## Subscribing to Events

In order to receive events from the WebSocket server, you must first subscribe to them.

::tip
When using the **Streamer.bot Client** library and its `.on()`{lang} method, this is handled automatically!

## Event Schema
All events are sent from the server in stringified JSON format.

Event payloads follow the following base schema:

::code-group
  ```ts [JSON Schema]
  {
    "timeStamp": Date, // ISO 8601 DateTime
    "event": {
      "source": string,
      "type": string
    },
    "data": {
      // Data for the respective event
    }
  }
  ```
  ```json [example.json]
  {
    "timeStamp": "2022-01-30T21:32:04.4588947-05:00",
    "event": {
      "source": "Twitch",
      "type": "ChatMessage"
    },
    "data": {
      // Twitch Chat Message Data
    }
  }
  ```
