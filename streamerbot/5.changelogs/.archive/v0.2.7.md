## Details
First off, this is not the fabled `1.0` release, this is a maintenance release to deal with the shutdown of `Twitch PubSub`.

While the main focus on this release is the removal of `Twitch PubSub`, I went ahead and backported a few fixes from `1.0`, so all the changes are listed below.
### Twitch
On **April 14th 2025**, `Twitch` will finally shut down their `PubSub` service, while `0.2.6` will still techncially function, it will keep trying to connect to the service, which is not ideal.

So, this maintenance release completely removes the Twitch PubSub service from Streamer.bot.  It also adds a new method for the `Viewer Count Update` trigger, so this keeps functioning.  The only downside is, `Twitch Community Goals` are no longer supported since there is no equivalent data available via `EventSub`, if this ever changes, this will be added/updated in a future version.

The following triggers have been **removed**:
* `Twitch Ad Midroll`
* `Twitch PubSub Connected`
* `Twitch PubSub Disconnected`
The following triggers **no longer function**:
* `Twitch Community Goal Contribution`
* `Twitch Community Goal Ended`
