## Details
### General
As part of a sweeping update, last stable release was November 2023, so there's some updates that Streamer.bot received, that have been applied to Speaker.bot as well, most are internal handling.  There is still some more I need to go through, so hopefully everything is working correctly.
### ElevenLabs
Going through `ElevenLabs` to add support for `Stability`/`Similarity`, I noticed a parsing error when getting default/voice settings.  A wrong data type was being used, causing `Stability` to be always `1`, and `Similarity` always `0`.  This is now fixed for default values.

`Pitch` and `Rate` are now being used as `Similarity` and `Stability` respectively for `ElevenLabs` voices, and acceptable values are `-1` for `default`, or `0` to `100` for a **percentage** value.

The `UI` will update when an `ElevenLabs` voice is selected, and show `Similarity` and `Stability`, and `Pitch`/`Rate` for all other voices.  This naming won't be changed everywhere, that is part of a future update.

`ElevenLabs` voices should now match, or as close as possible given variance, the voices generated from the website.
### Voice Gate
With this release, there is a new feature, `Voice Gate`.

What this will allow you to do, is monitor your microphone, or other input audio device, and set a threshold that would `auto-pause` Speaker.bot.

A threshold and timeout can be set that will `auto-unpause` Speaker.bot after it has been paused by the `Voice Gate`

The 3 settings that govern the VoiceGate, can be updated in real time to fine tune adjustments.

::warning
Because the audio is touching input devices, `Speaker.bot` needs to open the device, however, **nothing is recorded**, the device is just opened.
::

#### Profiles
You can save VoiceGate settings to different profiles, allowing you to switch between settings easier.

Starting with, `Streamer.bot 0.2.4` will have a new sub-action to allow for activating of profiles. This sub-action will be introduced in `alpha.19`
### UberDuck
Surprise, surprise, `UberDuck` was not working again.

While investigating what was going on, it was loading over **1000** voices, and looking at the data, it was a mix of there own voices, combined with `Amazon Polly`, `Google`, and `Azure Cognitive Services`. I'm not sure when they added the 3 external services, but they require a different endpoint to use them, and its not even documented. So, as an interim fix, the external service voices are removed, leaving only **27** voices available.

Of these remaining **27** voices, **some** still seem to have issues, mostly `500 server errors`, and there isn't much I can do about that.

I am also debating on removing `UberDuck` as a service from **Speaker.bot** outright, as the value just doesn't seem to be there anymore, especially after last years issue and the removal of all of there AI voices.
### Twitch
#### New Scopes
The following scopes are required on the `broadcaster` account now, these supoport the move from `PubSub` events to `EventSub` events, as well as using the `API` to send a chat message
* user:write:chat
* user:read:emotes
* moderator:read:blocked_terms
* moderator:read:chat_settings
* moderator:read:unban_requests
* moderator:read banned_users
* moderator:read:chat_messages
* moderator:read:moderators
* moderator:read:vips
#### PubSub
It was mentioned in the last TwitchDev broadcast, that sometime in the near future PubSub would be deprecated. So starting with this alpha, I have moved a good majority of the events that rely on PubSub over to there counterparts on EventSub.
### StreamElements
The UI for StreamElements has been updated to have the split style with logging into your account, and sub-service connections. All the underlying code has also been updated to support this new common display.
